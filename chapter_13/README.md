<a id="#ch13exe1"></a>**13-1. Stars:** Find an image of a star. Make a grid of
stars appear on the screen.

<a id="#ch13exe2"></a>**13-2. Better Stars:** You can make a more realistic star
pattern by introducing randomness when you place each star. Recall that
you can get a random number like this:

from random import randint
random_number = randint(-10,10)

This code returns a random integer between --10 and 10. Using your code
in [Exercise 13-1](#ch13exe1), adjust each star's position by a random
amount.
