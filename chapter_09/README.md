---------------

<a id="#ch9exe1"></a>**9-1. Restaurant:** Make a class called
`Restaurant`. The `\_\_init\_\_()` method for
`Restaurant` should store two attributes: a
`restaurant_name` and a `cuisine_type`. Make a
method called `describe_restaurant()` that prints these two
pieces of information, and a method called `open_restaurant()`
that prints a message indicating that the restaurant is open.

Make an instance called `restaurant` from your class. Print
the two attributes individually, and then call both methods.

<a id="#ch9exe2"></a>**9-2. Three Restaurants:** Start with your class from
[Exercise 9-1](#ch9exe1). Create three different instances from the
class, and call `describe_restaurant()` for each instance.

<a id="#ch9exe3}**9-3. Users:** Make a class called [User]{.literal"></a>. Create
two attributes called `first_name` and `last_name`,
and then create several other attributes that are typically stored in a
user profile. Make a method called `describe_user()` that
prints a summary of the user's information. Make another method called
`greet_user()` that prints a personalized greeting to the
user.

Create several instances representing different users, and call both
methods for each user.
