TRY IT YOURSELF
---------------

Write a separate program to accomplish each of these exercises. Save
each program with a filename that follows standard Python conventions,
using lowercase letters and underscores, such as *simple_message.py* and
*simple_messages.py*.

<a id="#ch2exe1"></a>**2-1. Simple Message:** Store a message in a variable, and
then print that message.

<a id="#ch2exe2"></a>**2-2. Simple Messages:** Store a message in a variable, and
print that message. Then change the value of your variable to a new
message, and print the new message.
