9-1: Restaurant
---

Make a class called `Restaurant`. The `__init__()` method for `Restaurant` should store two attributes: a `restaurant_name` and a `cuisine_type`. Make a method called `describe_restaurant()` that prints these two pieces of information, and a method called `open_restaurant()` that prints a message indicating that the restaurant is open.

Make an instance called `restaurant` from your class. Print the two attributes individually, and then call both methods.

```python
class Restaurant():
    """A class representing a restaurant."""

    def __init__(self, name, cuisine_type):
        """Initialize the restaurant."""
        self.name = name.title()
        self.cuisine_type = cuisine_type

    def describe_restaurant(self):
        """Display a summary of the restaurant."""
        msg = self.name + " serves wonderful " + self.cuisine_type + "."
        print("\n" + msg)

    def open_restaurant(self):
        """Display a message that the restaurant is open."""
        msg = self.name + " is open. Come on in!"
        print("\n" + msg)

restaurant = Restaurant('the mean queen', 'pizza')
print(restaurant.name)
print(restaurant.cuisine_type)

restaurant.describe_restaurant()
restaurant.open_restaurant()
```

Output:

```
The Mean Queen
pizza

The Mean Queen serves wonderful pizza.

The Mean Queen is open. Come on in!
```

9-2: Three Restaurants
---

Start with your class from Exercise 9-1. Create three different instances from the class, and call `describe_restaurant()` for each instance.

```python
class Restaurant():
    """A class representing a restaurant."""

    def __init__(self, name, cuisine_type):
        """Initialize the restaurant."""
        self.name = name.title()
        self.cuisine_type = cuisine_type

    def describe_restaurant(self):
        """Display a summary of the restaurant."""
        msg = self.name + " serves wonderful " + self.cuisine_type + "."
        print("\n" + msg)

    def open_restaurant(self):
        """Display a message that the restaurant is open."""
        msg = self.name + " is open. Come on in!"
        print("\n" + msg)

mean_queen = Restaurant('the mean queen', 'pizza')
mean_queen.describe_restaurant()

ludvigs = Restaurant("ludvig's bistro", 'seafood')
ludvigs.describe_restaurant()

mango_thai = Restaurant('mango thai', 'thai food')
mango_thai.describe_restaurant()
```

Output:

```
The Mean Queen serves wonderful pizza.

Ludvig'S Bistro serves wonderful seafood.

Mango Thai serves wonderful thai food.
```

9-3: Users
---

Make a class called `User`. Create two attributes called `first_name` and `last_name`, and then create several other attributes that are typically stored in a user profile. Make a method called `describe_user()` that prints a summary of the user's information. Make another method called `greet_user()` that prints a personalized greeting to the user.

Create several instances representing different users, and call both methods for each user.

```python
class User():
    """Represent a simple user profile."""

    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, username, email, location):
        """Initialize the user."""
        self.first_name = first_name.title()
        self.last_name = last_name.title()
        self.username = username
        self.email = email
        self.location = location.title()

    def describe_user(self):
        """Display a summary of the user's information."""
        print("\n" + self.first_name + " " + self.last_name)
        print("  Username: " + self.username)
        print("  Email: " + self.email)
        print("  Location: " + self.location)

    def greet_user(self):
        """Display a personalized greeting to the user."""
        print("\nWelcome back, " + self.username + "!")

eric = User('eric', 'matthes', 'e_matthes', 'e_matthes@example.com', 'alaska')
eric.describe_user()
eric.greet_user()

willie = User('willie', 'burger', 'willieburger', 'wb@example.com', 'alaska')
willie.describe_user()
willie.greet_user()
```

Output:

```
Eric Matthes
  Username: e_matthes
  Email: e_matthes@example.com
  Location: Alaska

Welcome back, e_matthes!

Willie Burger
  Username: willieburger
  Email: wb@example.com
  Location: Alaska

Welcome back, willieburger!
```

9-4: Number Served
---

Start with your program from Exercise 9-1 (page 166). Add an attribute called `number_served` with a default value of 0. Create an instance called `restaurant` from this class. Print the number of customers the restaurant has served, and then change this value and print it again.

Add a method called `set_number_served()` that lets you set the number of customers that have been served. Call this method with a new number and print the value again.

Add a method called `increment_number_served()` that lets you increment the number of customers who've been served. Call this method with any number you like that could represent how many customers were served in, say, a day of business.

```python
class Restaurant():
    """A class representing a restaurant."""

    def __init__(self, name, cuisine_type):
        """Initialize the restaurant."""
        self.name = name.title()
        self.cuisine_type = cuisine_type
        self.number_served = 0

    def describe_restaurant(self):
        """Display a summary of the restaurant."""
        msg = self.name + " serves wonderful " + self.cuisine_type + "."
        print("\n" + msg)

    def open_restaurant(self):
        """Display a message that the restaurant is open."""
        msg = self.name + " is open. Come on in!"
        print("\n" + msg)

    def set_number_served(self, number_served):
        """Allow user to set the number of customers that have been served."""
        self.number_served = number_served

    def increment_number_served(self, additional_served):
        """Allow user to increment the number of customers served."""
        self.number_served += additional_served

restaurant = Restaurant('the mean queen', 'pizza')
restaurant.describe_restaurant()

print("\nNumber served: " + str(restaurant.number_served))
restaurant.number_served = 430
print("Number served: " + str(restaurant.number_served))

restaurant.set_number_served(1257)
print("Number served: " + str(restaurant.number_served))

restaurant.increment_number_served(239)
print("Number served: " + str(restaurant.number_served))
```

Output:

```
The Mean Queen serves wonderful pizza.

Number served: 0
Number served: 430
Number served: 1257
Number served: 1496
```

9-5: Login Attempts
---

Add an attribute called `login_attempts` to your `User` class from Exercise 9-3 (page 166). Write amehtod called `increment_login_attempts()` that increments the value of `login_attempts` by 1. Write another method called `reset_login_attempts()` that resets the value of `login_attempts` to 0.

Make an instance of the `User` class and call `increment_login_attempts()` several times. Print the value of `login_attempts` to make sure it was incremented properly, and then call `reset_login_attempts()`. Print `login_attempts` again to make sure it was reset to 0.

```python
class User():
    """Represent a simple user profile."""

    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, username, email, location):
        """Initialize the user."""
        self.first_name = first_name.title()
        self.last_name = last_name.title()
        self.username = username
        self.email = email
        self.location = location.title()
        self.login_attempts = 0

    def describe_user(self):
        """Display a summary of the user's information."""
        print("\n" + self.first_name + " " + self.last_name)
        print("  Username: " + self.username)
        print("  Email: " + self.email)
        print("  Location: " + self.location)

    def greet_user(self):
        """Display a personalized greeting to the user."""
        print("\nWelcome back, " + self.username + "!")

    def increment_login_attempts(self):
        """Increment the value of login_attempts."""
        self.login_attempts += 1

    def reset_login_attempts(self):
        """Reset login_attempts to 0."""
        self.login_attempts = 0

eric = User('eric', 'matthes', 'e_matthes', 'e_matthes@example.com', 'alaska')
eric.describe_user()
eric.greet_user()

print("\nMaking 3 login attempts...")
eric.increment_login_attempts()
eric.increment_login_attempts()
eric.increment_login_attempts()
print("  Login attempts: " + str(eric.login_attempts))

print("Resetting login attempts...")
eric.reset_login_attempts()
print("  Login attempts: " + str(eric.login_attempts))
```

Output:

```
Eric Matthes
  Username: e_matthes
  Email: e_matthes@example.com
  Location: Alaska

Welcome back, e_matthes!

9-6: Ice Cream Stand
---

An ice cream stand is a specific kind of restaurant. Write a class called `IceCreamStand` that inherits from the `Restaurant` class you wrote in Exercise 9-1 (page 166) or Exercise 9-4 (page 171). Eitehr version of the class will work; just pick the one you like better. Add an attribute called `flavors` that stores a list of ice cream flavors. Write a method that displays theese flavors. Create an instance of `IceCreamStand`, and call this method.

```python
class Restaurant():
    """A class representing a restaurant."""

    def __init__(self, name, cuisine_type):
        """Initialize the restaurant."""
        self.name = name.title()
        self.cuisine_type = cuisine_type
        self.number_served = 0

    def describe_restaurant(self):
        """Display a summary of the restaurant."""
        msg = self.name + " serves wonderful " + self.cuisine_type + "."
        print("\n" + msg)

    def open_restaurant(self):
        """Display a message that the restaurant is open."""
        msg = self.name + " is open. Come on in!"
        print("\n" + msg)

    def set_number_served(self, number_served):
        """Allow user to set the number of customers that have been served."""
        self.number_served = number_served

    def increment_number_served(self, additional_served):
        """Allow user to increment the number of customers served."""
        self.number_served += additional_served

class IceCreamStand(Restaurant):
    """Represent an ice cream stand."""

    def __init__(self, name, cuisine_type='ice_cream'):
        """Initialize an ice cream stand."""
        super().__init__(name, cuisine_type)
        self.flavors = []

    def show_flavors(self):
        """Display the flavors available."""
        print("\nWe have the following flavors available:")
        for flavor in self.flavors:
            print("- " + flavor.title())

big_one = IceCreamStand('The Big One')
big_one.flavors = ['vanilla', 'chocolate', 'black cherry']

big_one.describe_restaurant()
big_one.show_flavors()
```

Output:

```
The Big One serves wonderful ice_cream.

We have the following flavors available:
- Vanilla
- Chocolate
- Black Cherry
```

9-7: Admin
---

An administrator is a special kind of user. Write a class called `Admin` that inherits from the `User` class you wrote in Exercise 9-3 (page 166) or Exercise 9-5 (page 171). Add an attribute, `privileges`, that stores a list of strings like `"can add post"`, `"can delete post"`, `"can ban user"`, and so on. WRite a method called `show_privileges()` that lists the administrator's set of privileges. Create an instance of `Admin`, and call your method.

```python
class User():
    """Represent a simple user profile."""

    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, username, email, location):
        """Initialize the user."""
        self.first_name = first_name.title()
        self.last_name = last_name.title()
        self.username = username
        self.email = email
        self.location = location.title()
        self.login_attempts = 0

    def describe_user(self):
        """Display a summary of the user's information."""
        print("\n" + self.first_name + " " + self.last_name)
        print("  Username: " + self.username)
        print("  Email: " + self.email)

    def increment_login_attempts(self):
        """Increment the value of login_attempts."""
        self.login_attempts += 1

    def reset_login_attempts(self):
        """Reset login_attempts to 0."""
        self.login_attempts = 0

class Admin(User):
    """A user with administrative privileges."""

    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, username, email, location):
        """Initialize the admin."""
        super().__init__(first_name, last_name, username, email, location)
        self.privileges = []

    def show_privileges(self):
        """Display the privileges this administrator has."""
        print("\nPrivileges:")
        for privilege in self.privileges:
            print("- " + privilege)

eric = Admin('eric', 'matthes', 'e_matthes', 'e_matthes@example.com', 'alaska')
eric.describe_user()

eric.privileges = [
    'can reset passwords',
    'can moderate discussions',
    'can suspend accounts',
    ]

eric.show_privileges()
```

Output:

```

[top üîù](#)

9-8: Privileges
---

Write a separate `Privileges` class. The class should have one attribute, `privileges`, that stores a list of strings as described in Exercise 9-7. Move the `show_privileges()` method to this class. Make a `Privileges` instance as an attribute in the `Admin` class. Create a new instance of `Admin` and use your method to show its privileges.

```python
class User():
    """Represent a simple user profile."""

    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, username, email, location):
        """Initialize the user."""
        self.first_name = first_name.title()
        self.last_name = last_name.title()
        self.username = username
        self.email = email
        self.location = location.title()

        self.login_attempts += 1

    def reset_login_attempts(self):
        """Reset login_attempts to 0."""
        self.login_attempts = 0

class Admin(User):
    """A user with administrative privileges."""

        super().__init__(first_name, last_name, username, email, location)

    # Initialize an empty set of privileges.
        self.privileges = Privileges()

class Privileges():

    def show_privileges(self):
        print("\nPrivileges:")
        if self.privileges:

    'can moderate discussions',
    'can suspend accounts',
    ]
eric.privileges.privileges = eric_privileges
eric.privileges.show_privileges()
```

Output:

```

9-9: Battery Upgrade
---

Use the final version of [*electric_car.py*](../chapter_09/electric_car.py) from this section. Add a method to the `Battery` class called `upgrade_battery()`. This method should check the battery size and set the capacity to 85 if it isn't already. Make an electric car with a default battery size, call `get_range()` once, and then call `get_range()` a second time after upgrading the battery. You should see an increase in the car's range.

```python

9-10: Imported Restaurant
---

Using your latest `Restaurant` class, store it in a module. Make a separate file that imports `Restaurant`. Make a `Restaurant` instance, and call one of `Restaurant`'s methods to show that the `import` statement is working properly.

*restaurant.py:*

```python

9-12: Multiple Modules
---

Store the `User` class in one module, and store the `Privileges` and `Admin` classes in a separate module. In a separate file, create an `Admin` instance and call `show_privileges()` to show that everything is still working correctly.

9-13: OrderedDict Rewrite
---

Start with Exercise 6-4 (page 108), where you used a standard dictionary to represent a glossary. Rewrite the program using the `OrderedDict` class and make sure the order of the output matches the order in which key-value pairs were added to the dictionary.

***Note:** In Python 3.6, dictionaries store keys in order. However, this is not guaranteed to work in all versions of Python, so you should still use an OrderedDict when you need key-value pairs to be stored in a particular order.*

```python
from collections import OrderedDict

glossary = OrderedDict()

glossary['string'] = 'A series of characters.'
glossary['comment'] = 'A note in a program that the Python interpreter ignores.'
glossary['list'] = 'A collection of items in a particular order.'
glossary['loop'] = 'Work through a collection of items, one at a time.'
glossary['dictionary'] = "A collection of key-value pairs."
glossary['key'] = 'The first item in a key-value pair in a dictionary.'
glossary['value'] = 'An item associated with a key in a dictionary.'
glossary['conditional test'] = 'A comparison between two values.'
glossary['float'] = 'A numerical value with a decimal component.'
glossary['boolean expression'] = 'An expression that evaluates to True or False.'

for word, definition in glossary.items():
    print("\n" + word.title() + ": " + definition)
```

Output:

```
String: A series of characters.

Comment: A note in a program that the Python interpreter ignores.

List: A collection of items in a particular order.

Loop: Work through a collection of items, one at a time.

Dictionary: A collection of key-value pairs.

Key: The first item in a key-value pair in a dictionary.

Value: An item associated with a key in a dictionary.

Conditional Test: A comparison between two values.

Float: A numerical value with a decimal component.

Boolean Expression: An expression that evaluates to True or False.

9-14: Dice
---

The module `random` contains functions that generate random numbers in a variety of ways. The function `randint()` returns an integer in the range you provide. the following code returns a number between 1 and 6:

```python
from random import randint
x = randint(1, 6)
```

Make a class `Die` with one attribute called `sides`, which has a default value of 6. Write a method called `roll_die()` that prints a random number between 1 and the number of sides the die has. Make a 6-sided die and roll it 10 times.

Make a 10-sided die and a 20-sided die. Roll each die 10 times.

```python
from random import randint

class Die():
    """Represent a die, which can be rolled."""

    def __init__(self, sides=6):
        """Initialize the die."""
        self.sides = sides

    def roll_die(self):
        """Return a number between 1 and the number of sides."""
        return randint(1, self.sides)

# Make a 6-sided die, and show the results of 10 rolls.
d6 = Die()

results = []
for roll_num in range(10):
    result = d6.roll_die()
    results.append(result)
print("10 rolls of a 6-sided die:")
print(results)

# Make a 10-sided die, and show the results of 10 rolls.
d10 = Die(sides=10)

results = []
for roll_num in range(10):
    result = d10.roll_die()
    results.append(result)
print("\n10 rolls of a 10-sided die:")
print(results)

# Make a 20-sided die, and show the results of 10 rolls.
d20 = Die(sides=20)

results = []
for roll_num in range(10):
    result = d20.roll_die()
    results.append(result)
print("\n10 rolls of a 20-sided die:")
print(results)
```

Output:

```
10 rolls of a 6-sided die:
[5, 5, 6, 3, 6, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1]

10 rolls of a 10-sided die:
[8, 9, 8, 10, 7, 1, 3, 5, 3, 4]

10 rolls of a 20-sided die:
[4, 3, 18, 17, 3, 1, 13, 12, 5, 14]
```
