TRY IT YOURSELF
---------------

Try these short programs to get some firsthand experience with Python's
lists. You might want to create a new folder for each chapter's
exercises to keep them organized.

<a id="#ch3exe1"></a>**3-1. Names:** Store the names of a few of your friends in
a list called `names`. Print each person's name by accessing
each element in the list, one at a time.

<a id="#ch3exe2"></a>**3-2. Greetings:** Start with the list you used in
[Exercise 3-1](#ch3exe1), but instead of just printing each person's
name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the
same, but each message should be personalized with the person's name.

<a id="#ch3exe3"></a>**3-3. Your Own List:** Think of your favorite mode of
transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that
stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements
about these items, such as "I would like to own a Honda motorcycle."
