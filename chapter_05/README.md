TRY IT YOURSELF
---------------

<a id="#ch5exe1"></a>**5-1. Conditional Tests:** Write a series of conditional
tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for
the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:

car = \'subaru\'
print(\"Is car == \'subaru\'? I predict True.\")
print(car == \'subaru\')

print(\"\\nIs car == \'audi\'? I predict False.\")
print(car == \'audi\')

 - Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each
line evaluates to `True` or `False`.

 - Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to
`True` and another 5 tests evaluate to `False`.

<a id="#ch5exe2"></a>**5-2. More Conditional Tests:** You don't have to limit the
number of tests you create to 10. If you want to try more comparisons,
write more tests and add them to *conditional_tests.py*. Have at least
one `True` and one `False` result for each of the
following:

 - Tests for equality and inequality with strings

 - Tests using the `lower()` function

 - Numerical tests involving equality and inequality, greater than and
less than, greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to

 - Tests using the `and` keyword and the `or` keyword

 - Test whether an item is in a list

 - Test whether an item is not in a list
