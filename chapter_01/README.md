Setting Up
---

Python runs on all modern operating systems, but the setup process is slightly different on each operating system:

- [Linux](linux_setup.html)
- [OS X](osx_setup.html)
- [Windows](windows_setup.html)

TRY IT YOURSELF
---------------

The exercises in this chapter are exploratory in nature. Starting in
[Chapter 2](..\chapter_02\README.md#ch02), the challenges you'll solve will be based
on what you've learned.

<a id="#ch1exe1"></a>**1-1. python.org:** Explore the Python home page
(*<http://python.org/>*) to find topics that interest you. As you become
familiar with Python, different parts of the site will be more useful to
you.

<a id="#ch1exe2"></a>**1-2. Hello World Typos:** Open the *hello_world.py* file
you just created. Make a typo somewhere in the line and run the program
again. Can you make a typo that generates an error? Can you make sense
of the error message? Can you make a typo that doesn't generate an
error? Why do you think it didn't make an error?

<a id="#ch1exe3"></a>**1-3. Infinite Skills:** If you had infinite programming
skills, what would you build? You're about to learn how to program. If
you have an end goal in mind, you'll have an immediate use for your new
skills; now is a great time to draft descriptions of what you'd like to
create. It's a good habit to keep an "ideas" notebook that you can refer
to whenever you want to start a new project. Take a few minutes now to
describe three programs you'd like to create.
